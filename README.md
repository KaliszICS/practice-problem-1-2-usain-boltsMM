# Instructions 

Each question should be output on a separate line.
Remember to use the variables to do the operations and output, not the values.

1. Assign the integers 2, 5, 3 to three different variables. Output their sum and product on separate lines.

2. Assign the integers 10, 3 to two different variables. Output the quotient (rounded down) and the remainder on separate lines.
 
3. Assign the doubles 5.3 and 5.2 to two different variables. Output the exact quotient.

4. Assign 2, 3, 4 to three different varaibles.  Add 2 and 3 together, then multiply it by 4. Output the result.

5. Assign 5 to a variable.  Increase the avlue of the varaible by 3.5.  Output it. Remember to use the correct data type.
